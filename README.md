Creates new employee folders like admin assist does, but in C# with a gui instead of a Python console app

This allows managers who aren't comfortable using the console to generate properly formatted directories for new employees quickly and efficiently.

_Creates new employee folders in the active directory as well as the resume directory and formats them in the style already used in the given directory_


Confirmation is provided when the folders are created successfully and the information clears allowing the rapid creation of directories for multiple employees
